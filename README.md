# MAT243-Applied-Statistics-for-STEM-I
Source code (Jupyter Notebook) for my Projects in my MAT-243 STATS for STEM I course at SNHU as well as .csv files (if applicable) and Report.

All Jupyter notebook code is coded in Python. It says HTML because the file is an HTML file for it. I will write and add a .py file with the code at some point and update the info here to reflect that change.

UPDATE: Added .py files for the Jupyter Notebook for Project 1, Project 2 and Project 3. 

I found that installing Anaconda (most updated version for python) and running Visual Studio Code from Anaconda, then proceeding to open and run the .py file fixed the error for it not finding the 'numpy' module.
