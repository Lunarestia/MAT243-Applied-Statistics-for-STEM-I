# # Project One: Data Visualization, Descriptive Statistics, Confidence Intervals
# 
# This notebook contains the step-by-step directions for Project One. It is very important to run through the steps in order. Some steps depend on the outputs of earlier steps. Once you have completed the steps in this notebook, be sure to write your summary report. 
# 
# 
# You are a data analyst for a basketball team and have access to a large set of historical data that you can use to analyze performance patterns. The coach of the team and your management have requested that you use descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques to study distributions of key performance metrics that are included in the data set. These data-driven analytics will help make key decisions to improve the performance of the team. You will use the Python programming language to perform the statistical analyses and then prepare a report of your findings to present for the teamâ€™s management. Since the managers are not data analysts, you will need to interpret your findings and describe their practical implications. 
# 
# 
# There are four important variables in the data set that you will study in Project One. 
# 
# | <div style="text-align: left"> Variable </div>  |   <div style="text-align: left"> What does it represent? </div> |
# | -- | --  |
# | <div style="text-align: left"> pts </div> | <div style="text-align: left"> Points scored by the team in a game </div> |
# | <div style="text-align: left"> elo_n </div> | <div style="text-align: left"> A measure of the relative skill level of the team in the league </div> |
# | <div style="text-align: left"> year_id </div> | <div style="text-align: left"> Year when the team played the games </div> |
# | <div style="text-align: left"> fran_id </div> | <div style="text-align: left"> Name of the NBA team </div> |
# 
# 
# The ELO rating, represented by the variable **elo_n**, is used as a measure of the relative skill of a team. This measure is inferred based on the final score of a game, the game location, and the outcome of the game relative to the probability of that outcome. The higher the number, the higher  the relative skill of a team.
# 
# 
# In addition to studying data on your own team, your management has assigned you a second team so that you can compare its performance with your own team's. 
# 
# | <div style="text-align: left"> Team </div>  |   <div style="text-align: left"> What does it represent? </div> |
# | -- | --  |
# | <div style="text-align: left"> Your Team </div> | <div style="text-align: left"> This is the team that has hired you as an analyst. This is the team that you will pick below. See Step 2.</div> |
# | <div style="text-align: left"> Assigned Team </div> | <div style="text-align: left"> This is the team that the management has assigned to you to compare against your team. See Step 1. </div> |
# 
# 
# Reminder: It may be beneficial to review the summary report template for Project One prior to starting this Python script. That will give you an idea of the questions you will need to answer with the outputs of this script.

# ## Step 1: Data Preparation & the Assigned Team
# This step uploads the data set from a CSV file. It also selects the assigned team for this analysis. Do not make any changes to the code block below.
# 
# 1. The **assigned team** is the <font color='blue'><strong>Chicago Bulls</strong></font> from the years <font color='blue'><strong>1996-1998</strong> </font>

# ## Step 3: Data Visualization: Points Scored by Your Team
# The coach has requested that you provide a visual that shows the distribution of points scored by your team in the years 2013-2015. The code below provides two possible options. Pick **ONE** of these two plots to include in your summary report. Choose the plot that you think provides the best visual for the distribution of points scored by your team. In your summary report, you must explain why you think your visual is the best choice.

# Click the block of code below and hit the **Run** button above.

# ## Step 6: Descriptive Statistics: Relative Skill of Your Team
# The management of your team wants you to run descriptive statistics on the relative skill of your team from 2013-2015. In this project, you will use the variable 'elo_n' to respresent the relative skill of the teams. Calculate descriptive statistics including the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation for the relative skill of your team. Make the following edits to the code block below:
# 
# 1. <font color='red'> Replace <strong>??MEAN_FUNCTION??</strong> with the name of Python function that calculates the mean. </font>
# 2. <font color='red'> Replace <strong>??MEDIAN_FUNCTION??</strong> with the name of Python function that calculates the median. </font>
# 3. <font color='red'> Replace <strong>??VAR_FUNCTION??</strong> with the name of Python function that calculates the variance. </font>
# 4. <font color='red'> Replace <strong>??STD_FUNCTION??</strong> with the name of Python function that calculates the standard deviation. </font>

print('Median =', round(median,2))
print('Variance =', round(variance,2))
print('Standard Deviation =', round(stdeviation,2))
print('Mode =', round(mode,2))

# ## Step 7 - Descriptive Statistics - Relative Skill of the Assigned Team
# The management also wants you to run descriptive statistics for the relative skill of the Bulls from 1996-1998. Calculate descriptive statistics including the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation for the relative skill of the assigned team.

print('Standard Deviation =', round(stdeviation,2))
print('Mode =', round(mode,2))


# ## Step 8: Confidence Intervals for the Average Relative Skill of All Teams in Your Team's Years
# The management wants to you to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the average relative skill of all teams in 2013-2015. To construct a confidence interval, you will need the mean and standard error of the relative skill level in these years. The code block below calculates the mean and the standard deviation. Your edits will calculate the standard error and the confidence interval. Make the following edits to the code block below:
# 
# 1. <font color='red'> Replace <strong>??SD_VARIABLE??</strong> with the variable name representing the standard deviation of relative skill of all teams from your years. </font> (Hint: the *standard deviation* variable is in the code block below)
# 2. <font color='red'> Replace <strong>??CL??</strong> with the confidence level of the confidence interval. </font>
# 3. <font color='red'> Replace <strong>??MEAN_VARIABLE??</strong> with the variable name representing the mean relative skill of all teams from your years. </font> (Hint: the *mean* variable is in the code block below)
# 4. <font color='red'> Replace <strong>??SE_VARIABLE??</strong> with the variable name representing the standard error. </font> (Hint: the *standard error* variable is in the code block below)
# 
# 
# The management also wants you to calculate the probability that a team in the league has a relative skill level less than that of the team that you picked. Assuming that the relative skill of teams is Normally distributed, Python methods for a Normal distribution can be used to answer this question. The code block below uses two of these Python methods. Your task is to identify the correct Python method and report the probability.
